    Variable Names
    A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:
    A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
    A variable name cannot start with a number
    A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
    Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
    A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

# Legal variable names:

myvar = "Otavio"
my_var = "Otavio"
_my_var = "Otavio"
myVar = "Otavio"
MYVAR = "Otavio"
myvar2 = "Otavio"

# Illegal variable names:

# 2myvar = "Otavio"
# my-var = "Otavio"
# my var = "Otavio"

#Multi Words Variable Names
#Variable names with more than one word can be difficult to read.

#There are several techniques you can use to make them more readable:

#Camel Case
#Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:

myVariableName = "Otavio"

#Camel Case
#Each word, except the first, starts with a capital letter:

MyVariableName = "Otavio"

#Snake Case
#Each word is separated by an underscore character:

my_variable_name = "Otavio"
