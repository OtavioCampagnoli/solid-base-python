# To check if you have python installed on a linux PC, use the follow command on terminal:

# python --version

# Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a developer you write Python (.py) files in a text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed.

# example:

# python nameFile.py

## Simple as that. Save your file. Open your command line, navigate to the directory where you saved your file, and run:

# cd ./introduction
# python get-started.py

# Python Version
# To check the Python version of the editor, you can find it by importing the sys module:

import sys

print(sys.version) # 3.12.2 (main, Feb 21 2024, 00:00:00) [GCC 13.2.1 20231205 (Red Hat 13.2.1-6)]
# output:
# My name is Otavio Campagnoli, thanks to interpret me!

# The Python Command Line
# To test a short amount of code in python sometimes it is quickest and easiest not to write the code in a file. This is made possible because Python can be run as a command line itself.

# Type the following on the Windows, Mac or Linux command line:


#python or py

# python
# Python 3.12.2 (main, Feb 21 2024, 00:00:00) [GCC 13.2.1 20231205 (Red Hat 13.2.1-6)] on linux
# Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
# >>> print("Hello, world!")
# Hello, world!
# >>> 

# use exit() to quit the python command line interface
