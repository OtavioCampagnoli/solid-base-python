# To check if you have python installed on a linux PC, use the follow command on terminal:

# python --version

# Python is an interpreted programming language, this means that as a developer you write Python (.py) files in a text editor and then put those files into the python interpreter to be executed.

# example:

# python nameFile.py

## Simple as that. Save your file. Open your command line, navigate to the directory where you saved your file, and run:

# cd ./introduction
# python get-started.py
