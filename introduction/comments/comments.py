Python Comments
Comments can be used to explain Python code.

Comments can be used to make the code more readable.

Comments can be used to prevent execution when testing code.

"""
# This is a comment
print ("Hello World!")

#print ("Hello World!")

print ("Hello World!") # this is a comment

# print ("Hello World!")
print ("Hello World!")

# Multiline Comments
# Python does not really have a syntax for multiline comments.

# To add a multiline comment you could insert a # for each line:

#This is a comment
#written in
#more than just one line
print("Hello, World!")

"""
Or, not quite as intended, you can use a multiline string.

Since Python will ignore string literals that are not assigned to a variable, you can add a multiline string (triple quotes) in your code, and place your comment inside it:
"""
print("Otavio Campagnoli")

# As long as the string is not assigned tdo a variable, Python will read the code, but then ignore it, and you have made a multiline comment.
